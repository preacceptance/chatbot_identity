# System Requirements
This code is written in R and was tested with R 4.4.1. It's likely to work with any version of R >= 4.0.0.

It does not require any additional software beyond the base R installation. Required packages will be installed automatically when you run the code, if they are not already present on your system.
No non-standard hardware or software is required to run the code.

Typical time to install and run the code is less than 5 minutes.

For reproducing the results, you can use the provided R scripts in the allocated study directories (e.g., e1.R, e2.R, etc.).
